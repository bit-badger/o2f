## Framework Setup

For each of our applications, we'll need certain over-arching things set up. All implementations will use RavenDB to store our session data, and we'll also load some posts and pages into the database, so once we start writing the actual handlers for the application, we'll be able to see what we've done.

### Individual Implementations

Each of these not only evolves from step 2 to step 3, they also evolve as Uno moves to Cinco. It may help your understanding to read each of them, even if your interest is just in one of them.
